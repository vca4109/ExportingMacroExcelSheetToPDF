🖨️ VBA Macro: ExportToPDF
🔍 Purpose
This macro allows users to export the first worksheet of the current Excel workbook directly to a PDF file, making it easy to generate shareable, print-ready reports or documentation.

⚙️ How It Works
Prompts the user with a Save As dialog box to select a filename and location for the PDF file.

Automatically selects the first worksheet in the workbook (you can customize this to target any specific sheet).

Converts and exports the selected worksheet as a PDF using Excel’s built-in PDF export functionality.

Displays a confirmation message upon successful export.

💡 Key Features
Simple, user-friendly process with no need to manually export.

Saves time when creating deliverables for submission or record-keeping.

Ensures formatting and layout remain consistent in the PDF output.

📄 Output Example
If you run the macro and choose the file path:

D:\Documents\ProjectReport.pdf
The macro will generate a clean, professional-looking PDF version of Sheet1 saved at that path.

📌 Use Case
Use this when:

You need to submit Excel data as non-editable reports (e.g., for Aconex or email).

You want to share a polished version of a worksheet without exposing formulas or formatting issues.

You're preparing reports, checklists, or summaries for printing or client distribution.
